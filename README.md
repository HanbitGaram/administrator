# Administrator
This code defines Administrator, an abstract class written in PHP. This class is located in the Administrator namespace and has an abstract method that handles administrator information. I will explain each part in detail below.

## Namespace:
`namespace Administrator;`: This code defines the classes that belong to the Administrator namespace. Namespace is used to prevent name conflicts of classes, functions, and constants, and helps to group related codes.

## Class:
`abstract class Administrator`: This part defines an abstract class called Administrator. Abstract classes cannot be directly instantiated, and subclasses must provide specific implementations.

## Abstract Methods:
`abstract public function getAdministrator(String$administratorName);`: This method is used to obtain information for administrators. Since it is declared as an abstract method, there is no actual implementation and must be implemented in a subclass. Accepts $administratorName of type String as a parameter.


`abstract public function setAdministrator (String $administratorName, AdministratorLevel $level);`: This method is used to set information for administrators. Similarly, it is declared as an abstract method and has no actual implementation and should be implemented in a subclass. Accepts two parameters. One is `$administratorName` of type String and the other is `$level` of type `AdministratorLevel`.

## Comments:
`@param`: This comment provides a description of the parameters of the method. For example, `@param String $administratorName` Just put administrator's name in. is a description of the `$administratorName` parameter in the getAdministrator method. These comments help you understand and document the code.

This code defines an abstract class that deals with administrator information, and the actual implementation is expected to take place in a subclass. You can create a subclass that inherits this abstract class and create a custom administrator class by implementing abstract methods specifically.
