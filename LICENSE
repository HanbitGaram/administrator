Administrator License
Version 9.0, January 1991
http://www.administrator.tld/licenses/

Creating a license myself requires legal expertise and takes
into account legal matters related to license design. Depending on the purpose
and requirements for which you want to create a license,
you may be able to select and modify the appropriate license.

However, licensing requires both legal issues
and knowledge in computer science and requires professional legal advice.

If you select and modify a license,
you must comply with the license and specify the changes.

It is important to consult legal experts and discuss with the community
to make the best decision before creating or modifying a license.

Licenses provide important regulations for the use,
modification, and redistribution of software and
should be handled with caution.

Therefore, it is recommended that these works
be supported by experts or legal advice.
